Here is documents of custom hooks

When we use custom hooks?
ans: When we use functional components and then if we need some same logic will have to use different components 
then we use custom hooks. Which we write code one time but we can use it many time when we need it.


Custom hooks naming convention: we have to start use then name 
ex: useCounter

Here :
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function useCounter(val) {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(val)

    const increment = () => {
        setValue(value + 1)
    }
    const decrement = () => {
        setValue(value - 1)
    }
    return [value, increment, decrement]
}

export default useCounter

I write function then return it now we can use it where we need then just call it 

previous useState()  same as.

const [value,increment, decrement] = useCounter()
